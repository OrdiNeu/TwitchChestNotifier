# Twitch Chest Notifier
Quick python script I wrote to give an audio cue to the user whenever the twitch chest shows up on screen. I wrote this so I could focus on other things while accumulating points for [my friend's Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/thedugnutt).

I have a separate version for Ubuntu, which I'll upload once I get the time to do so.
